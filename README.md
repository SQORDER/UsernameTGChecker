<h1> UTGC </h1>
<h4> Username Telegram Checker </h4>

> [!NOTE]
> In connection with the release of the new Fragment application from Telegram, I decided that it would be useful to create a proxy parser and a check for validity. This will make it easier to find good usernames and occupy them faster than others.

> [!TIP]
> ### How to use? <br>
> <code>python {index}</code>

> [!CAUTION]
> Sometimes there may be errors.
